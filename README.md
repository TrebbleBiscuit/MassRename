# MassRename
This program is used to rename files with sections separated by delimiters that need to be rearranged.

In order to use it you must create a folder called "ToRename" in the same directory as the python file. Place the files you would like to rename inside of it. The name of the folder can be modified in the coniguration file.

confighelper.py is a file to help the user generate an IndexList for the config file
